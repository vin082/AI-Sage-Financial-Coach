SAVINGS INTEREST RATES — IMPORTANT NOTE

Savings interest rates change frequently. The agent will never quote a specific
current interest rate as rates can change at any time and vary by product and balance.
Customers should check current rates at lloydsbank.com or speak to a branch.

HOW MUCH SHOULD I SAVE?

General principles:
- Build emergency fund first (3 months essential spend)
- Then contribute to workplace pension (at least to employer match level)
- Then consider ISA allowance for tax-efficient growth
- Additional savings after these priorities

The exact allocation depends on individual goals, debt levels, tax situation and
time horizons. This requires personalised advice which the coaching agent will
refer to a qualified adviser.
