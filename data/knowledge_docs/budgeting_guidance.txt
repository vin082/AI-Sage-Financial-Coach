THE 50/30/20 BUDGETING RULE

One widely-used budgeting framework divides your take-home pay into three buckets:
- 50% on Needs: rent/mortgage, groceries, utilities, transport, insurance
- 30% on Wants: eating out, entertainment, subscriptions, hobbies
- 20% on Savings and debt repayment: emergency fund, ISA contributions, paying down debt

This is a guideline, not a rigid rule. Your specific situation, income level and
cost of living will affect what percentages make sense for you.

EMERGENCY FUNDS

Financial experts broadly recommend building an emergency fund covering 3-6 months
of essential living expenses. This is money held in an easily accessible account
(not invested) specifically for unexpected events: job loss, urgent repairs, medical costs.

Steps to build an emergency fund:
1. Calculate your monthly essential spend (rent + utilities + groceries + transport)
2. Set a target of 3x that figure as your minimum emergency fund
3. Open a separate easy-access savings account to keep it distinct from day-to-day money
4. Automate a fixed monthly transfer immediately after payday (pay yourself first)

SAVINGS HABITS

Research consistently shows that automating savings on payday — before you have a
chance to spend — is the most effective approach. This is sometimes called "paying
yourself first."

Useful habits:
- Set up a standing order to move savings on payday
- Use round-up features to save small amounts automatically
- Review subscriptions quarterly — the average UK household wastes £624/year on
  unused subscriptions (Source: Lloyds Bank research, 2023)
- Track all subscriptions in one place to spot duplication

UNDERSTANDING SPENDING CATEGORIES

Essentials (should remain relatively fixed):
- Housing costs (rent or mortgage)
- Utilities (gas, electricity, water, broadband)
- Groceries
- Essential transport (commute)
- Insurance

Discretionary (controllable):
- Eating out and takeaways
- Entertainment and streaming services
- Clothing and fashion (beyond essentials)
- Gym, hobbies, and leisure

Discretionary spending is not "bad" — it improves quality of life. The goal is
intentional spending: know what you're spending and choose it consciously.

DEBT MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES

Two common approaches:
- Avalanche method: Pay minimum on all debts, put extra money on highest interest rate first.
  Mathematically optimal — saves the most interest.
- Snowball method: Pay minimum on all debts, put extra money on smallest balance first.
  Psychologically effective — builds momentum with quick wins.

Neither approach is universally "right" — the best method is the one you will stick to.

General guidance: if your debt interest rate exceeds your savings interest rate,
prioritise debt repayment over savings (except maintaining a small emergency fund).
